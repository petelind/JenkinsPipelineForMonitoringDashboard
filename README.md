Nice work, Jeff, here is the pipeline which will use your tests to run staging container (you can copy & change docker-compose.yml to run it locally). 
In case you dont have access / rights to Jenkins - use container file I provided, you have to import workflow inside it, though. 
(I'll add .jenkins folder mapping later on).
